#### Computer vision and data analysis
Tried face and eye detection in OpenCv using Haar cascades. Learned from the tutorial written by 
Mr. Rabin Poudyal ( https://blog.goodaudience.com/real-time-face-and-eyes-detection-with-opencv-54d9ccfee6a8 ).
And in data analysis part, learned the importance of pandas in data analysis. Also used pandas 
to extract datasets from web API.
